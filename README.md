# Brewtal


A social platform for sharing coffee brewing profiles with each other so that we can stop wasting precious beans and start drinking excellent coffee the first time, every time.

I'm sure for some of you, getting the perfect extraction is all part of the joy of drinking coffee. Screwing up a couple batches is well worth the satisfaction of dialling in your brew. As for me, I'm sick of wasting beans on poor extraction attempts, and I believe others out there share the same sentiment.

That's why I'm building this app. To provide a place where we can share our techniques with one another and nail down the perfect brew for every bean out there. Not so that we can provide everybody's perfect cup, but to try and get damn close so you can hone in on what you like, quickly.

## Development

- UI Built with SvelteKit
- API powered by the Rocket web framework for Rust

Why? Just for the joy of it. It's my first project using either, so we'll see how it goes.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
